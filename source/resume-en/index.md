# Work experience

## Agora/Data Team - Full-Stack Engineer (May 2020 ~ October 2022)

### DataLego Platform

DataLego is a tool platform that includes a complete data process (data reporting and distribution, metadata, real-time offline task scheduling, sql query and visual reports).

I independently develop the development and operation of more than half of the subsystems (metadata, real-time offline tasks, data security, and partial report visualization) of the platform 0-1.
The work content includes pre-demand discussion, part of product form design, business MySQL library table structure design, Golang/NodeJS back-end and React+TS front-end development, as well as data content migration, post-operation and maintenance (monitoring alarms, logs and security, optimization iteration). In the absence of developers, the platform with this closed-loop capability was launched in about a year, and it became the main data tool used by analysts, data warehouses, developers and external analysts in the entire data platform. .

The whole project contains many complex features. For example, in a single offline task, in addition to completing the main process of multi-source-processor-multi-sink, it also supports the review of complex state machines, task history version, task DAG bloodline management, and downstream personnel. The batch rerun logic, the algorithm intelligent scheduling of task multi-queue and other functions.
Finally, by trying the abstraction of various processes and dimensions, reducing complexity and improving versatility, not only the requirements are completed, but some general development services are also abstracted, such as API suites that support historical version approval, RBAC system authority center, and general data authority center. , UI to change the data table center, etc.

### Other projects

Responsible for the web-side development of the Compass data disk project.
It is a data dashboard platform with high UI complexity. Considering the performance requirements of the first rendering of the data dashboard, NextJS is used for selection.
It is noticed that the BFF layer of NextJS is basically forwarding logic, and the surrounding swg2NextJSAPI npm script is developed to generate BFF code from Swagger custom (two processes, swagger generates API metadata and ts model; template file and metadata generate BFF interface file).
In addition, based on the reusable features of multi-language and multi-theme, npm general packages such as i18n-sdk and theme-provider and the corresponding management platform are abstracted.

## Qiniu Cloud/Front-end Architecture and Experience Department/Front-end & Live Cloud Department/Full Stack (July 2016 ~ May 2020)

### Qiniu Cloud Developer Platform: Portal

The Portal Console is a large site with multiple front-end sites combined under one domain name.

I am solely responsible for the development and technical evolution of cloud live broadcasting, cloud directing, real-time audio and video cloud, API acceleration, and cloud SMS site related to live broadcasting.
In terms of development, it can independently complete the process of code development, debugging, testing, and online upgrade, and ensure a certain quality. In terms of technological evolution, from the early AngularJS 1.x+CoffeeScript to the later React+TypeScript, and maintaining iterative updates to the basic component library, the difficulty of evolution lies in the complex multi-site coupling and huge historical code, we use functional module extraction. The method of decoupling is transformed, and the evolution is gradually promoted. He has certain experience in overall web-side software engineering.
At the same time, it is responsible for the corresponding web backend of the front end, which is implemented in Go language.
In terms of product development experience, he has a certain understanding of the related business of cloud live broadcast, HTTPS certificate productization, data visualization display, etc.

### Qiniu Web Client Privatization

Privatization is a set of front-end code that can be deployed privately multiple times to display private features. I am responsible for the privatization of all public modules in Qiniu's front-end, including base library, template warehouse boilerplate, public module warehouse, etc. From the perspectives of code, pre-compilation, and runtime, I formulated corresponding strategies and the principle of maximum and minimum changes, and completed the privatization of the corresponding code. Let the site using the modified code base complete the privatization, and the time is greatly reduced.

### other projects

Independently responsible for the development of the full life cycle of the web side of the Qiniu Cloud Director Project.
Participated in the development of Qiniu document station, computer room data visualization and other projects.
